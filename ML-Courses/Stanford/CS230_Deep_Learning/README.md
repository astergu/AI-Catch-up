## Class Notes

### Lecture 2: Deep Learning Intuition

- Machine Learning pipeline
  - Data
  - Input
  - Output
  - Architecture
  - Loss
- Example machine learning applications
  - A school wants to use `Face Identification` for recognizing students in facilities (dining hall, gym, pool...)
    - `K-Nearest Neighbors`
  - You want to use `Face Clustering` to group pictures of the same people on your smart phone 
    - `K-Means Algorithm`
  - Art generation
    - inspect its style & content
  - Trigger word detection: given a 10sec audio speech, detect the word "activate".
