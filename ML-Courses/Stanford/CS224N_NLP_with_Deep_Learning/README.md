[Course Homepage](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1234/) [[course videos]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmVRLeJRkl4&list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH4v6133s9LFPRHjEmbmJ)

**Scope**

- The foundations of the effective modern methods for deep learning applied to NLP
  - Basics first, then key methods used in NLP in 2023: `Word vectors`, `feed-forward networks`, `recurrent networks`, `attention`, `encoder-decoder models`, `transformers`, `large pre-trained language models`, etc.
- A big picture understanding of human languages and the difficulties in understanding and producing them via computers
- An understanding of and **ability to build systems** (in Pytorch) for some of the major problems in NLP
  - Word meaning, dependency parsing, machine translation, question answering

**High-Level Plan for Assignments**

- Ass1 is hopefully an easy on ramp - A Jupyter/IPython Notebook
- Ass2 is pure Python (numpy) but expects you to do (multivariate) calculus, so you really understand the basics
- Ass3 introduces PyTorch, building a feed-forward network for dependency parsing
- Ass4 and Ass5 use PyTorch on a GPU (Microsoft Azure)
- For Final Project
  - Do the default project, which is a question answering system
  - Propose a custom final project

## Lecture 1: Introduction and Word Vectors

### Representating words by their context

- **Distributional semantics**: A word's meaning is given by the words that frequently appear close-by

## Word Vectors

We will build a dense vector for each word, chosen so that it is aimilar to vectors of words that appear in similar contexts.

> `word vectors` are also called `word embeddings` or `word representations`. They are a `distributed` representations.

## Word2vec

`Word2vec` (Mikolov et al. 2013) is a framework for learning word vectors.

### Idea

- We have a large corpus ("body") of text
- Every word in a fixed vocabulary is represented by a `vector`
- Go through each position `t` in the text, which as a center word `c` and context ("outside") word `o`
- Use the `simiilarity of the word vectors` for `c` and `o` to `calculate the probabilty` of `o` given `c` (or vice versa)
- `Keep adjusting the word vectors` to maximize this probability
