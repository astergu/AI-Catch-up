# AI-Catchup

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to sharing and learning about machine learning, deep learning, and especially the state-of-art generative AI. I have curated a collection of learning resources, sample code, books, and practical project experiences related to AI. The goal is to assist developers who are interested in AI to get started and delve deeper into the subject.

## Contents

- **Learning Resources:** A curated list of materials covering topics such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and more.
- **Sample Code:** Various AI code examples, ranging from basic to advanced, for learning and hands-on practice.
- **Project Experiences:** Real-world application cases to help you apply the acquired knowledge to practical projects.
